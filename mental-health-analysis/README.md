# 🧠 Mental Health in Tech Analysis

This project analyzes survey responses from tech workers to explore mental health patterns, workplace support, and treatment-seeking behavior.

### 📊 What I Did:
- Cleaned and standardized messy text/categorical data (gender, age, etc.)
- Removed outliers (e.g. age <16 or >100)
- Grouped by treatment status, gender, and age brackets
- Analyzed employer support like mental health benefits & wellness programs
- Visualized key trends using countplots, bar charts, and pie charts

---

### 📈 Visualizations:
- Countplot: Treatment vs No Treatment
- Pie chart: Mental health benefits availability
- Barplot: Country-wise mental health support awareness
- Heatmap: Mental health workplace factor correlation

### 🛠️ Tools Used:
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
