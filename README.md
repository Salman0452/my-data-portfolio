# 📊 Data Projects Portfolio

Hey! I'm **Salman**, a Software Engineering student and aspiring AI/Data Engineer.  
I'm currently on a journey to level up my data skills by building one project a day using Python, Pandas, and visualization libraries.

This repository contains my completed data analysis projects — cleaned, analyzed, and visualized using real-world datasets.  
I update this repo daily with new work as I continue learning.
