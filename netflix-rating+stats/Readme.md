# 🎬 Netflix Data Analysis & Statistical Exploration

This project explores the Netflix dataset using Python, pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib — with a special focus on applying statistical concepts like distributions, simulations, and probability functions.

---

## 📊 Objective

The main goal of this project was to:
- Analyze Netflix content trends (e.g., types, durations)
- Clean and prepare the dataset
- Perform visualizations (histograms, bar charts, etc.)
- Apply basic statistical methods (e.g., normal distribution, binomial, etc.)

---

## 📂 Dataset

- Dataset: [`netflix_titles.csv`](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows)
- Fields include: Title, Type, Director, Country, Date Added, Duration, etc.

---

## 🧠 Key Features

✅ Data cleaning (null values, unknown labels)  
✅ Trend analysis: content type distribution  
✅ Duration-based insights  
✅ Visualization using matplotlib and seaborn  
✅ Introduction to statistical methods:
- Normal Distribution
- Binomial Simulation
- Exponential Distribution
- `.cdf()` and `.rvs()` methods from `scipy.stats`

---

## 📈 Visualization Examples

- Histogram of movie durations  
- Countplot of content type (Movie vs TV Show)  
- Boxplot for duration distribution  
- Simulated user behaviors using `binom.rvs()`  
- Probability calculations using `norm.cdf()`

---

## 🧪 Note

This project marks my **first attempt at integrating statistical distributions** into real-world data analysis. Some parts were challenging (especially `.cdf()` and `.rvs()`), and I took guided help to understand and apply them properly.

I will continue improving this in future projects — but this one is proudly uploaded to reflect my learning progress 💪
